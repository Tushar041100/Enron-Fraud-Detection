# Enron Fraud Detection 
#
### Project Overview  
In this project, we will play detective, and put all our machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.  
  
### Background
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, we must build a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. We must also include individuals who weren't directly involved which means individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement, or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.
  
### Why this Project?  
This project will help me practice the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.  
    
It will also teach me how to extract/identify useful features that best represents the data, a few of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms, and how to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms used.  
  
### What will I learn?
The goals of this project is to be able to:      
- Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset
- Validate a machine learning result using test data
- Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics
- Create, select and transform features compare the performance of machine learning algorithms
- Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance
- Communicate the machine learning algorithm's results clearly
